# Poweradmin-plus - a fork of the web-based control panel for PowerDNS.

Poweradmin plus will one day be a modern web-based DNS administration tool for Bert Hubert's PowerDNS server. Right now it's just a fresh fork of the Poweradmin tool whose development has seemingly stalled.

Current list of new features:
- Full LDAP support including authentication based on group membership
- Option to automatically create an account (and assign a default role) upon successful LDAP authentication
- Auto assignment of a pre-defined permission template ID to the auto-registered users
